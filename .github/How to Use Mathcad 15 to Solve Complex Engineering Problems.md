In this article, we will show you how to use Mathcad 15 to solve a simple example problem that involves finding the area of a triangle using Heron's formula. We will also show you how to use some of the features of Mathcad 15, such as units, variables, functions, plots, and tables.
 
## Step 1: Define the Problem
 
The first step is to define the problem that you want to solve using Mathcad 15. You can use natural language and mathematical notation to describe the problem in a clear and concise way. For example, you can write:
 `
Given: A triangle with sides a = 5 cm, b = 7 cm, and c = 8 cm
Find: The area of the triangle
` 
You can also insert images or diagrams to illustrate the problem visually. For example, you can insert an image of a triangle with labeled sides:
 ![A triangle with sides a = 5 cm, b = 7 cm, and c = 8 cm](triangle.png) 
## Step 2: Define the Variables and Units
 
The next step is to define the variables and units that you will use in your calculations. Mathcad 15 supports a wide range of units and dimensions, and automatically converts them as needed. You can use the Units palette or type them directly using keyboard shortcuts. For example, you can define the variables and units for the sides of the triangle as follows:
 `
a := 5 cm
b := 7 cm
c := 8 cm
` 
You can also use Greek letters or subscripts for your variables by using the Symbol palette or typing them using keyboard shortcuts. For example, you can define the variable for the semiperimeter of the triangle as follows:
 `
s := (a + b + c)/2
` 
## Step 3: Define the Formula
 
The next step is to define the formula that you will use to solve the problem. You can use natural mathematical notation to write the formula in Mathcad 15. You can also use built-in functions or define your own functions using the Function palette or typing them directly. For example, you can define the formula for Heron's formula as follows:
 `
A := sqrt(s*(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c))
` 
## Step 4: Solve and Display the Result
 
The final step is to solve and display the result of your calculation. You can use the Evaluate button or press Ctrl+= to evaluate your formula and display the result in Mathcad 15. You can also format your result using different options, such as decimal places, significant digits, scientific notation, etc. For example, you can display the result of your calculation as follows:
 `
A = 16.248 cm^2
` 
## Step 5: Explore More Features
 
You can use Mathcad 15 to do more than just solving simple problems. You can also use it to create plots, tables, matrices, vectors, differential equations, integrals, sums, products, etc. You can also use it to document your calculations using text, comments, headers, footers, etc. You can also use it to share your calculations with others using different formats, such as PDF, HTML, XML, etc.
